<h1>About Chen Yang</h1>
<p>
  A little about my background: I am a software product development manager at THG Energy Solutions who is super passionate about technology. I started my current role about two years ago fresh out of grad school, and during this job I have had the opportunity to learn about the many aspects of software development. What I enjoy the most about being a product manager is I get to be the bridge between our development team and business team, and being in the center of how the whole product come together.

  On weekends when Iâ€™m not learning coding, I enjoy cycling, kayaking, cooking, and great movies. I currently live in Austin, TX.
